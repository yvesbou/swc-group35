questions to matej:

we had a default constructor for board, and a parameterized, so I decided to delete the default, since both implement initialize cells,
but the parameterized does initialize playerType as well
There is no default constructor available in 'src.Board' was then a error in Fleet constructor, why? and what is in this case best practice
