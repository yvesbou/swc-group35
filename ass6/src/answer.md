Obviously is the employee the one needs to be modeled.
Since it's the most concrete ie. the least abstract concept
which has the fields that are viewed and changed. Therefore, we needed the EmployeeController to 
change the fields and update the view (ie. he uses Employee and updates the EmployeeView).
This means we also needed an EmployeeView class that gives us a view on the fields of the Employee.
Moreover, we created a MVCPatternDemo to show the functionality of the MVC Pattern. In which we created
a function retrieveEmployeeFromDatabase just for our sense of style so that the employee is created
in a standardized fashion.
